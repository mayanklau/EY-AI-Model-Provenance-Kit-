"""Pydantic models for comparison and scan results.

Houses the scoring decomposition and top-level output structures that
match the benchmark JSON shape.

Scoring recap::

    Pipeline Score (MFI-gated) — THE decision score:
        Tier 1/2 match  →  pipeline_score = mfi_score
        Tier 3 (soft)   →  pipeline_score = identity_score

    Identity Score  = NaN-aware weighted avg of EAS, NLF, LEP, END, WVC
    Tokenizer Score = 0.25 × TFV + 0.75 × VOA   (reporting only)
